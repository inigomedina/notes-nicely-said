People often use the words voice and tone interchangeably, but they’re not the same thing. Your voice is your company’s public personality. On the other hand, your tone changes to fit the situation. While your voice is more about you, your tone is about your readers and how they feel. Together, your voice and tone make up your writing style.

A voice is a reflection of the people behind it.
